## 102flower_testcopy.py

The script copies 819 images from the original 102 flower dataset that don't exist in 
flower dataset provided by Udacity and put it in Udacity flower_data/test folder.
 
The original 102 flower dataset can be downloaded from 
http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/102flowers.tgz
including its labels: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/imagelabels.mat
The file 102flowers.tgz should be untared on "root_dir"
and imagelabels.mat should be copied in "root_dir"
and just change the "root_dir" appropriately.

The 102 flower dataset from Udacity can be downloaded from
https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/nd188/flower_data.zip
This file should be also unziped to "root_dir"
